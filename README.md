# Accident-Risk-Analysis
This repository contains the project Accident Risk Analysis which was submitted by my team in the Stat-a-thon held at VIT Vellore. <br>
My team secured 3rd position in that contest. This Project analyses the data given by the Ministry of Road Tansport and Highways
regarding the Road Accidents in India 2017. PDF file of the Data released by the ministry is available at <br>
https://morth.nic.in/sites/default/files/Road_Accidents_in_India_2017.pdf <br>
The project uses **R programming** to perform the analysis and display graphs.
